# Task 1 Sales Prediction
Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of a product that customer will purchase, taking into account various factors such as advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection.
In business that offers products or services, the role of a data scientist is crucial for predicting future sales. They utilise machine learning techniques in python to analyse and interpret data, allowing them to make informed decisions regarding advertising costs. By leveraging these predictions, business can optimise their advertising strategies and maximise sales potential. Letâ€™s embark on the journey of sales using machine in python.
I've utilized diverse #analytics and #machinelearning techniques to analyze and interpret data in order to make informed decisions regarding advertising costs. By leveraging these predictions, businesses can optimize their advertising strategies and maximize sales potential.

# Task 2 Credit Card fraud Detection
Build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions.
Preprocess and normalize the transaction data, handle class imbalance issues, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train a classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random forests, to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, and consider techniques like oversampling or undersampling for improving results.

# Task 3 Iris Flower Classification
Classification of iris flowers is perhaps the best-known example of machine learning. The aim is to classify iris flowers among three species (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) from sepals' and petals' length and width measurements. The iris data set contains fifty instances of each of the three species.
