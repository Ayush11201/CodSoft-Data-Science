# Task 1 Sales Prediction
Sales prediction involves forecasting the amount of a product that customer will purchase, taking into account various factors such as advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection.
In business that offers products or services, the role of a data scientist is crucial for predicting future sales. They utilise machine learning techniques in python to analyse and interpret data, allowing them to make informed decisions regarding advertising costs. By leveraging these predictions, business can optimise their advertising strategies and maximise sales potential. Letâ€™s embark on the journey of sales using machine in python.
I've utilized diverse #analytics and #machinelearning techniques to analyze and interpret data in order to make informed decisions regarding advertising costs. By leveraging these predictions, businesses can optimize their advertising strategies and maximize sales potential.

# Task 2 Credit Card fraud Detection
Build a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions.
Preprocess and normalize the transaction data, handle class imbalance issues, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train a classification algorithm, such as logistic regression or random forests, to classify transactions as fraudulent or genuine. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score, and consider techniques like oversampling or undersampling for improving results.

# Task 3 Iris Flower Classification
Classification of iris flowers is perhaps the best-known example of machine learning. The aim is to classify iris flowers among three species (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) from sepals' and petals' length and width measurements. The iris data set contains fifty instances of each of the three species.
Iris flower has three species; setosa, versicolor, and virginica, which differs according to their measurements. Now assume that you have the measurements of the iris flowers according to their species, and here your task is to train a machine learning model that can learn from the measurements of the iris species and classify them.
I hope you now have understood the case study of iris flower classification. Although the Scikit-learn library provides a dataset for iris flower classification, you can also download the same dataset from here for the task of iris flower classification with Machine Learning. Now in the section below, I will take you through how we can classify the iris flower species with machine learning using the Python programming language.
